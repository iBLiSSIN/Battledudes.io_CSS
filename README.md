# Battledudes.io_CSS
This is the first full release of Battledudes.io's CSS which will change your game's interface to be nicer/cooler
ALso the code is very clean, if you have experiment in CSS you can edit it yourself
But please keep my name as the owner of the original version after you edit it
It has took a lot of times to update & fix the code, hope you can [give me a subcribe](https://www.youtube.com/@_junako?sub_confirmation=1)!
