# About Better Battledudes.io's CSS
This is the first full release of Battledudes.io's CSS which will change your game's interface to be nicer/cooler

Also the code is very clean, if you have experiment in CSS you can edit it yourself

But please keep our names as the owners of the original version after you edit it

It has took a lot of times to update & fix the code, hope you can [give me a subcribe](https://www.youtube.com/@_junako?sub_confirmation=1)!
